## Syntax Notation

This guide uses a relatively standard, somewhat simplified flavor of Backus-Naur form. These syntax definitions are built on symbols, which are named elements of syntax whose names are placed in angle brackets. To define a symbol, the symbol’s tag in angle brackets is written, followed by the definition symbol (“::=”) and an expression defining the syntax of the symbol. Within these expressions, text should be interpreted literally unless between angle brackets, square brackets, or pipe characters. Expressions separated by pipe characters should be taken as the union of both expressions; any pattern which fits either expression will fit the expression formed with the pipe character between them. Expressions between square brackets should be seen as optional elements of a larger expression.
