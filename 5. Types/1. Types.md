# Types

In Stensl, a type is a set of values which share a common usage. Stensl is a strictly-typed language, meaning that there are instances where only values of certain types are permitted within certain constructs. There are five basic types which are available in every Stensl program: int, float, bool, string, char, void, and any. These are called primitive types. The latter two, void and any, have special properties, and thus are called special types. Any class which is declared in a Stensl program also becomes a valid type.
