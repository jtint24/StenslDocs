## The ‘any’ Type

In Stensl, the any type is the superset of all types. Any value can be assigned to the any type. However, values of the any type cannot be cast back to their original type; they may only be used within contexts where the any type itself is accepted. For this reason, using the any type itself is generally discouraged in constructing variables and functions.
