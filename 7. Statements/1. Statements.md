# Statements

Statements are individual instructions in Stensl. To promote well-formatted code, only one statement is allowed per line. However, there may be lines with no statements at all. Statements are identified through their keyword. Statements should not be confused with functions, which perform actions but which are embedded in expressions. Statements, by contrast, stand on their own.
