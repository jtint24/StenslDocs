# Notes on Version a1.0.0

Stensl is currently in version a1.0.0, the first alpha version. At this stage, Stensl should be considered fairly volatile, but stable enough to use for enduring projects. Given that there are no previous releases of Stensl, there are no notes for backward compatibility. For the same reason, there are no notes on differences from previous versions.

For more on Stensl versioning, see Appendix 2: Versioning.
